Gently push on the tabletop to ensure all legs are securely attached and the table doesn't wobble. If there is any wobble, re-check the tightness of the screws.\\n* **Action:** Place the table in its desired location.\\n* **Rationale:**  This final check verifies the successful assembly and confirms the table is safe and stable for use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Troubleshooting:**\\n\\n* **Screw won't start threading:**  Ensure the leg hole is perfectly aligned with the tabletop hole.  Apply slight pressure while turning the screw. If still difficult, double-check you are using the correct screw.\\n* **Table is wobbly:**  Loosen all screws slightly.  Place the table on a flat surface and re-tighten the screws, alternating between legs.\\n* **Screw strips (the head of the screw gets damaged):** Stop immediately! Trying to force a stripped screw can further damage the wood.

Place the tabletop *upside down* (bottom side facing up) on the cloth. This prevents scratching the tabletop surface during assembly.\\n* **Inventory Check:** Briefly confirm you have all the parts listed above.\\n\\n**Step 2: Attaching the First Leg (3-5 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Position Leg:** Take one leg and align the pre-drilled hole on the *top* of the leg with one of the pre-drilled holes on the *bottom* of the tabletop corner.  Ensure the leg is oriented as desired (consider any aesthetic details of the leg - grain direction, shape, etc.).\\n* **Insert Screw:** Take one double-ended screw.  Carefully insert the screw through the hole in the tabletop and into the hole in the leg. \\n* **Hand-Tighten:**  Using the Phillips head screwdriver, gently *hand-tighten* the screw.  Turn the screwdriver clockwise.  **Do not fully tighten yet!**  Just make it snug.  This allows for adjustments later.\\n* **Check Alignment:** Visually inspect that the leg is seated flush against the corner of the tabletop. If not, slightly loosen the screw and reposition the leg.\\n\\n**Step 3:  Attaching Remaining Legs (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Repeat Step 2:** Repeat the process outlined in Step 2 for the remaining three legs, attaching one leg to each corner of the tabletop. Remember to only *hand-tighten* the screws at this stage.\\n* **Continue Checking Alignment:** After attaching each leg, visually inspect to make sure all legs are roughly aligned and sitting properly against the tabletop.\\n\\n**Step 4: Final Tightening (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Tighten Screws in a Cross Pattern:**  Now that all legs are attached, start *fully tightening* the screws. **Important:** Tighten the screws in a cross pattern (like tightening lug nuts on a car wheel). For example:\\n    1. Tighten the screw on the front-left leg.\\n    2. Tighten the screw on the back-right leg.\\n    3. Tighten the screw on the front-right leg.\\n    4. Tighten the screw on the back-left leg.\\n    5. Repeat this pattern one more time, ensuring all screws are firmly tightened.\\n* **Do not overtighten!** Stop tightening when you feel resistance.  Overtightening can strip the screw holes or damage the wood.\\n\\n**Step 5:  Inspection & Finishing (2-3 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Turn the Table Right-Side Up:** Carefully turn the assembled table right-side up.\\n* **Stability Check:** Place the table on a level surface.  Gently apply pressure to the tabletop to test its stability. If any legs wobble, re-check the tightness of the screws.\\n* **Final Inspection:**  Visually inspect the table for any loose screws, misalignment, or surface imperfections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n* **Screw Quality:**  If the screws feel flimsy or are easily stripped, consider replacing them with higher-quality screws.\\n* **Wood Type:** The instructions assume a relatively soft wood.  Harder woods may require slightly more force to drive the screws.\\n* **Stripped Screws:**  If you strip a screw hole (the screwdriver spins and doesn't tighten the screw), there are repair techniques available online, but preventative care (using the correct screwdriver and not overtightening) is best.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis plan should guide you through a successful assembly of your side table!

You might feel a slight resistance as the edges of the board engage with the case. *Do NOT force it.*  If it\\'s difficult to insert, double-check the alignment of the ports.  A gentle rocking motion can sometimes help.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 4: Connect Fan Power Cable**\\n\\n**(Approx. Time: 1 minute)**\\n\\n1. **Locate FAN Header:** On the Raspberry Pi board, locate the \"FAN\" header. It\\'s typically a set of pins labeled clearly.  *Refer to your Raspberry Pi model\\'s documentation if you\\'re unsure of its location.*\\n2. **Connect Cable:** Carefully connect the power cable from the cooling fan (attached to the middle panel) to the \"FAN\" header. Pay attention to the polarity (usually indicated on both the cable and the header - often red is positive and black is negative).  Ensure the connection is firm and secure.\\n *Note: Some Raspberry Pi models may have a 3-pin or 4-pin FAN header.  The cable should be compatible. If your cable has only 3 pins and the header has 4, connect it to the first three pins.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 5: Attach the Lid**\\n\\n**(Approx. Time: 30 seconds)**\\n\\n1. **Align Clips:** Align the lid with the middle panel. You should see corresponding clips or grooves that allow the lid to snap into place.\\n2. **Press Down:** Press down firmly and evenly across the lid until all clips are securely engaged.  You should hear a clicking sound as each clip locks into position. *Do not force it.  If a clip refuses to engage, check the alignment and try again.*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Final Check:**\\n\\n*  Ensure all connections (power cable to FAN header) are secure.\\n*  Confirm that the lid is properly clipped and secured.\\n*  Verify that all Raspberry Pi ports are accessible through the case cutouts.\\n\\n**Your Raspberry Pi is now enclosed in its new case!**\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Troubleshooting:**\\n\\n* **Difficulty inserting Pi:** Double-check port alignment. Gently rock the board as you insert it.\\n* **Fan not spinning:** Verify the power cable is securely connected to the \"FAN\" header. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is powered on.\\n* **Lid not closing:** Ensure all clips are aligned. Avoid excessive force.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** This assembly plan is a general guide.

Place the tabletop *upside down* (bottom side facing up) on the cloth. This prevents scratching the tabletop surface during assembly.\\n* **Inventory Check:** Briefly confirm you have all the parts listed above.\\n\\n**Step 2: Attaching the First Leg (3-5 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Position Leg:** Take one leg and align the pre-drilled hole on the *top* of the leg with one of the pre-drilled holes on the *bottom* of the tabletop corner.  Ensure the leg is oriented as desired (consider any aesthetic details of the leg - grain direction, shape, etc.).\\n* **Insert Screw:** Take one double-ended screw.  Carefully insert the screw through the hole in the tabletop and into the hole in the leg. \\n* **Hand-Tighten:**  Using the Phillips head screwdriver, gently *hand-tighten* the screw.  Turn the screwdriver clockwise.  **Do not fully tighten yet!**  Just make it snug.  This allows for adjustments later.\\n* **Check Alignment:** Visually inspect that the leg is seated flush against the corner of the tabletop. If not, slightly loosen the screw and reposition the leg.\\n\\n**Step 3:  Attaching Remaining Legs (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Repeat Step 2:** Repeat the process outlined in Step 2 for the remaining three legs, attaching one leg to each corner of the tabletop. Remember to only *hand-tighten* the screws at this stage.\\n* **Continue Checking Alignment:** After attaching each leg, visually inspect to make sure all legs are roughly aligned and sitting properly against the tabletop.\\n\\n**Step 4: Final Tightening (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Tighten Screws in a Cross Pattern:**  Now that all legs are attached, start *fully tightening* the screws. **Important:** Tighten the screws in a cross pattern (like tightening lug nuts on a car wheel). For example:\\n    1. Tighten the screw on the front-left leg.\\n    2. Tighten the screw on the back-right leg.\\n    3. Tighten the screw on the front-right leg.\\n    4. Tighten the screw on the back-left leg.\\n    5. Repeat this pattern one more time, ensuring all screws are firmly tightened.\\n* **Do not overtighten!** Stop tightening when you feel resistance.  Overtightening can strip the screw holes or damage the wood.\\n\\n**Step 5:  Inspection & Finishing (2-3 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Turn the Table Right-Side Up:** Carefully turn the assembled table right-side up.\\n* **Stability Check:** Place the table on a level surface.  Gently apply pressure to the tabletop to test its stability. If any legs wobble, re-check the tightness of the screws.\\n* **Final Inspection:**  Visually inspect the table for any loose screws, misalignment, or surface imperfections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n* **Screw Quality:**  If the screws feel flimsy or are easily stripped, consider replacing them with higher-quality screws.\\n* **Wood Type:** The instructions assume a relatively soft wood.  Harder woods may require slightly more force to drive the screws.\\n* **Stripped Screws:**  If you strip a screw hole (the screwdriver spins and doesn't tighten the screw), there are repair techniques available online, but preventative care (using the correct screwdriver and not overtightening) is best.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis plan should guide you through a successful assembly of your side table!

Four double ended screws.', \"## Side Table Assembly Plan - Step-by-Step\\n\\nThis plan details how to assemble the side table with the provided parts. **Please read all steps before beginning.**\\n\\n**Tools Required:**\\n\\n* Phillips Head Screwdriver (size appropriate for the screws - test before applying force!) - *Crucially important to use the right size to avoid stripping the screw heads.*\\n* (Optional) Soft cloth or blanket to protect the tabletop surface during assembly.\\n\\n**Parts List:**\\n\\n* 1 x Tabletop\\n* 4 x Legs\\n* 4 x Double-Ended Screws\\n\\n\\n\\n**Assembly Steps:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Preparation & Protection (2 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Clear Workspace:** Ensure you have a clean, flat workspace with enough room to maneuver.\\n* **Protect Tabletop:** Lay the soft cloth or blanket down on your workspace.  Place the tabletop *upside down* (bottom side facing up) on the cloth. This prevents scratching the tabletop surface during assembly.\\n* **Inventory Check:** Briefly confirm you have all the parts listed above.\\n\\n**Step 2: Attaching the First Leg (3-5 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Position Leg:** Take one leg and align the pre-drilled hole on the *top* of the leg with one of the pre-drilled holes on the *bottom* of the tabletop corner.  Ensure the leg is oriented as desired (consider any aesthetic details of the leg - grain direction, shape, etc.).\\n* **Insert Screw:** Take one double-ended screw.  Carefully insert the screw through the hole in the tabletop and into the hole in the leg. \\n* **Hand-Tighten:**  Using the Phillips head screwdriver, gently *hand-tighten* the screw.  Turn the screwdriver clockwise.  **Do not fully tighten yet!**  Just make it snug.  This allows for adjustments later.\\n* **Check Alignment:** Visually inspect that the leg is seated flush against the corner of the tabletop. If not, slightly loosen the screw and reposition the leg.\\n\\n**Step 3:  Attaching Remaining Legs (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Repeat Step 2:** Repeat the process outlined in Step 2 for the remaining three legs, attaching one leg to each corner of the tabletop. Remember to only *hand-tighten* the screws at this stage.\\n* **Continue Checking Alignment:** After attaching each leg, visually inspect to make sure all legs are roughly aligned and sitting properly against the tabletop.\\n\\n**Step 4: Final Tightening (5-10 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Tighten Screws in a Cross Pattern:**  Now that all legs are attached, start *fully tightening* the screws. **Important:** Tighten the screws in a cross pattern (like tightening lug nuts on a car wheel). For example:\\n    1. Tighten the screw on the front-left leg.\\n    2. Tighten the screw on the back-right leg.\\n    3. Tighten the screw on the front-right leg.\\n    4. Tighten the screw on the back-left leg.\\n    5. Repeat this pattern one more time, ensuring all screws are firmly tightened.\\n* **Do not overtighten!** Stop tightening when you feel resistance.  Overtightening can strip the screw holes or damage the wood.\\n\\n**Step 5:  Inspection & Finishing (2-3 minutes)**\\n\\n* **Turn the Table Right-Side Up:** Carefully turn the assembled table right-side up.\\n* **Stability Check:** Place the table on a level surface.  Gently apply pressure to the tabletop to test its stability.

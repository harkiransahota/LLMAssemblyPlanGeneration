TASK 1:
zero_shot:
Create a step-by-step assembly plan for a small side table consisting of the following parts:
1. One tabletop with four pre-drilled holes on the bottom side of each corner (on the bottom face only, not going all the way through).
2. Four legs each with one pre-drilled hole on the top.
3. Four double ended screws.

A: ## Side Table Assembly Plan - Step-by-Step

This plan details how to assemble the side table with the provided parts. **Please read all steps before beginning.**

**Tools Required:**

* Phillips Head Screwdriver (size appropriate for the screws - test before applying force!) - *Crucially important to use the right size to avoid stripping the screw heads.*
* (Optional) Soft cloth or blanket to protect the tabletop surface during assembly.

**Parts List:**

* 1 x Tabletop
* 4 x Legs
* 4 x Double-Ended Screws



**Assembly Steps:**

**Step 1: Preparation & Protection (2 minutes)**

* **Clear Workspace:** Ensure you have a clean, flat workspace with enough room to maneuver.
* **Protect Tabletop:** Lay the soft cloth or blanket down on your workspace.  Place the tabletop *upside down* (bottom side facing up) on the cloth. This prevents scratching the tabletop surface during assembly.
* **Inventory Check:** Briefly confirm you have all the parts listed above.

**Step 2: Attaching the First Leg (3-5 minutes)**

* **Position Leg:** Take one leg and align the pre-drilled hole on the *top* of the leg with one of the pre-drilled holes on the *bottom* of the tabletop corner.  Ensure the leg is oriented as desired (consider any aesthetic details of the leg - grain direction, shape, etc.).
* **Insert Screw:** Take one double-ended screw.  Carefully insert the screw through the hole in the tabletop and into the hole in the leg. 
* **Hand-Tighten:**  Using the Phillips head screwdriver, gently *hand-tighten* the screw.  Turn the screwdriver clockwise.  **Do not fully tighten yet!**  Just make it snug.  This allows for adjustments later.
* **Check Alignment:** Visually inspect that the leg is seated flush against the corner of the tabletop. If not, slightly loosen the screw and reposition the leg.

**Step 3:  Attaching Remaining Legs (5-10 minutes)**

* **Repeat Step 2:** Repeat the process outlined in Step 2 for the remaining three legs, attaching one leg to each corner of the tabletop. Remember to only *hand-tighten* the screws at this stage.
* **Continue Checking Alignment:** After attaching each leg, visually inspect to make sure all legs are roughly aligned and sitting properly against the tabletop.

**Step 4: Final Tightening (5-10 minutes)**

* **Tighten Screws in a Cross Pattern:**  Now that all legs are attached, start *fully tightening* the screws. **Important:** Tighten the screws in a cross pattern (like tightening lug nuts on a car wheel). For example:
    1. Tighten the screw on the front-left leg.
    2. Tighten the screw on the back-right leg.
    3. Tighten the screw on the front-right leg.
    4. Tighten the screw on the back-left leg.
    5. Repeat this pattern one more time, ensuring all screws are firmly tightened.
* **Do not overtighten!** Stop tightening when you feel resistance.  Overtightening can strip the screw holes or damage the wood.

**Step 5:  Inspection & Finishing (2-3 minutes)**

* **Turn the Table Right-Side Up:** Carefully turn the assembled table right-side up.
* **Stability Check:** Place the table on a level surface.  Gently apply pressure to the tabletop to test its stability. If any legs wobble, re-check the tightness of the screws.
* **Final Inspection:**  Visually inspect the table for any loose screws, misalignment, or surface imperfections.




**Important Considerations:**

* **Screw Quality:**  If the screws feel flimsy or are easily stripped, consider replacing them with higher-quality screws.
* **Wood Type:** The instructions assume a relatively soft wood.  Harder woods may require slightly more force to drive the screws.
* **Stripped Screws:**  If you strip a screw hole (the screwdriver spins and doesn't tighten the screw), there are repair techniques available online, but preventative care (using the correct screwdriver and not overtightening) is best.



This plan should guide you through a successful assembly of your side table!  Enjoy!

Make the instructions easy to follow for beginners.

A: ## Assembly Manual: Your New Side Table!

**Congratulations on your new side table!** This manual will guide you through a simple, step-by-step assembly process. No special tools are required – everything you need is included!

**Before You Start:**

* **Unpack everything:** Carefully remove all components from the packaging.
* **Identify the parts:** Make sure you have all the parts listed below.
* **Clear Workspace:** Find a clean, flat surface to work on. Placing a cloth or cardboard down will protect your tabletop from scratches.
* **Estimated Assembly Time:** 5-10 minutes.



**Parts List:**

* **(A) Tabletop (x1):**  The flat, main surface of the table. Notice the four holes on the *underside* (the side that will face down when the table is upright).
* **(B) Legs (x4):** These support the tabletop. Notice the single hole at the top of each leg.
* **(C) Double-Ended Screws (x4):** These screws will attach the legs to the tabletop.



**Let’s Get Started!**

**Step 1: Preparing the Tabletop**

* **Turn the Tabletop Upside Down:** Carefully place the tabletop on your workspace with the *underside* facing up.  You should see the four pre-drilled holes.
   *(See Diagram 1)*

   **Diagram 1:**
   [Simple drawing showing the tabletop upside down with arrows pointing to the pre-drilled holes]

**Step 2: Attaching the First Leg**

* **Position the Leg:** Take one leg (B) and align the hole at the *top* of the leg with one of the holes on the underside of the tabletop (A).
   *(See Diagram 2)*
* **Insert the Screw:** Take one double-ended screw (C) and insert it through the hole in the leg (B) and into the pre-drilled hole in the tabletop (A).
* **Hand-Tighten:**  Turn the screw *clockwise* (to the right) with your fingers until it feels snug. **Do not overtighten!** You should feel resistance, but avoid forcing it. Just make it firmly in place for now.

   **Diagram 2:**
   [Simple drawing showing leg positioned under the tabletop with arrow indicating screw insertion point.  Double-ended screw is partially inserted.]

**Step 3: Attach the Remaining Legs**

* **Repeat Step 2:** Repeat the process from Step 2 for the remaining three legs.  Align each leg's hole with a tabletop hole, insert a screw, and hand-tighten until snug.
   *(See Diagram 3)*

   **Diagram 3:**
   [Simple drawing showing all four legs attached, but not yet fully tightened]

**Step 4: Final Tightening**

* **Tighten all Screws:** Once all four legs are attached (but not fully tightened), go back and gently tighten each screw a little bit more.  Alternate between screws (tighten one, then tighten the one opposite it) to ensure the table is stable and even. Again, **do not overtighten!** You could strip the wood.
* **Check for Stability:**  Gently press down on the tabletop. All four legs should be firmly on the ground, and the table shouldn't wobble.

**Step 5: Enjoy!**

* **Turn the Table Right-Side Up:** Carefully turn the assembled table over so it is standing on its legs.
* **Place and Enjoy:** Position your new side table where you like, and enjoy!



**Troubleshooting:**

* **Table Wobbles:** If the table wobbles, loosen all the screws slightly, press down firmly on the tabletop to ensure all four legs are touching the ground, and then re-tighten the screws, alternating between them.
* **Screw Won't Go In:** Double-check that you are aligning the hole in the leg with the pre-drilled hole in the tabletop. Do not force the screw.

TASK 1:
evaluation_aware:
Create a high-quality, step-by-step assembly plan for a small side table with the following parts:
1. One tabletop with four pre-drilled holes on the bottom side of each corner (on the bottom face only, not going all the way through).
2. Four legs each with one pre-drilled hole on the top.
3. Four double ended screws.
Your response will be evaluated and scored based on clarity, completeness, and usefulness, so ensure the instructions are well-structured and easy to follow.

A: ## Side Table Assembly Plan - Simple 4-Legged Design

**Estimated Assembly Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Tools Required:** Phillips Head Screwdriver (preferably with magnetic tip)
**Parts Included:**
* Tabletop (1)
* Legs (4)
* Double-Ended Screws (4)

**Safety First!** 
* Ensure you have adequate space to work.
* Be careful not to overtighten screws – this can damage the wood.
* If you are unsure about any step, stop and review the instructions.



**Step 1: Prepare the Tabletop**

**(Image: Tabletop placed upside down on a protected surface - a rug or blanket - showing the four pre-drilled holes.)**

* **Action:** Place the tabletop *upside down* on a soft, protective surface. This prevents scratching the finished surface during assembly.  A rug, towel, or blanket works well.
* **Rationale:**  Working with the tabletop upside down provides access to the pre-drilled holes for leg attachment. The protective surface prevents damage.

**Step 2: Attach the First Leg**

**(Image: Close-up showing the leg aligned with one corner of the tabletop, and the screw partially inserted.)**

* **Action:** Align one leg with a corner of the tabletop. The pre-drilled hole on the leg should align with one of the pre-drilled holes on the underside of the tabletop.
* **Action:** Insert one of the double-ended screws through the hole in the leg and into the corresponding hole in the tabletop. 
* **Action:** Using the Phillips head screwdriver, *gently* turn the screw clockwise. Do **not** fully tighten at this stage.
* **Rationale:** Starting with one leg allows for initial stability. Gently tightening the screw allows for minor adjustments in alignment during the attachment of the remaining legs.



**Step 3: Attach Remaining Legs (Repeat for each leg)**

**(Image: Showing two legs attached, but screws still loosely tightened. A third leg is shown about to be attached.)**

* **Action:** Repeat Step 2 for the remaining three legs.  Align each leg to a corner and loosely secure with a screw. 
* **Rationale:**  Attaching all legs loosely before fully tightening ensures all legs are aligned properly, resulting in a stable table.

**Step 4: Align and Tighten All Screws**

**(Image: Showing all four legs attached, hand tightening the screws, and then a screwdriver tightening the screws.)**

* **Action:**  Once all legs are loosely connected, carefully check that all the legs are fully and correctly seated against the tabletop.
* **Action:** *Starting with one leg*, carefully tighten the screw clockwise with the Phillips head screwdriver. Tighten until snug, but **do not overtighten**. Feel for resistance - stop turning when you feel it.
* **Action:** Repeat the tightening process for the remaining three screws, alternating between legs to distribute the pressure evenly.
* **Rationale:**  Alternating tightening prevents uneven pressure and potential warping or cracking of the wood. Gradual tightening ensures a secure connection without damage.



**Step 5: Final Inspection and Table Placement**

**(Image: The completed table standing upright, with a subtle shadow underneath showing stability. )**

* **Action:** Carefully turn the table upright.
* **Action:** Inspect the table for stability. Gently push on the tabletop to ensure all legs are securely attached and the table doesn't wobble. If there is any wobble, re-check the tightness of the screws.
* **Action:** Place the table in its desired location.
* **Rationale:**  This final check verifies the successful assembly and confirms the table is safe and stable for use.




**Troubleshooting:**

* **Screw won't start threading:**  Ensure the leg hole is perfectly aligned with the tabletop hole.  Apply slight pressure while turning the screw. If still difficult, double-check you are using the correct screw.
* **Table is wobbly:**  Loosen all screws slightly.  Place the table on a flat surface and re-tighten the screws, alternating between legs.
* **Screw strips (the head of the screw gets damaged):** Stop immediately! Trying to force a stripped screw can further damage the wood. Consider contacting customer support (if applicable) for a replacement screw.



This assembly plan is designed to be clear, concise, and easy to follow, even for someone with limited assembly experience.  The use of images improves comprehension and reduces ambiguity. The emphasis on *gentle* tightening minimizes the risk of damaging the furniture.

*   Repeat for the second armrest on the opposite side.

**Step 5: Attach Armrests to Backrest**
*   Position the backrest between the two armrests. 
*   Align the screw holes on the back of each armrest with the corresponding holes on the backrest.
*   Using four long bolts (without washers), secure the armrests to the backrest. Tighten, but do not fully tighten yet.

**Step 6: Mount Seat Assembly to Gas Lift** 
*   Carefully lower the assembled seat (with mechanism, armrests and backrest) onto the exposed top of the gas lift cylinder.  The center hole in the seat mechanism should fit snugly over the cylinder plug. *Applying gentle downward pressure will lock the cylinder in place.*

**Step 7: Final Tightening and Check**
*   Now that the chair is stable, fully tighten all bolts: those connecting the armrests to both the seat and the backrest, and those connecting the seat mechanism to the seat.
*   Check all connections to ensure they are secure.
*   Test all chair functions (height adjustment, tilt/swivel if applicable) to ensure they operate smoothly.



**Important Note:**  Double-check the orientation of the parts before attaching them, especially the armrests, to ensure a correct fit. Do not overtighten screws, as this could damage the components.

Three-part plastic case, consisting of: base (with plug-in connector for the middle panel and cutouts for ports), middle panel with a pre-installed cooling fan and attached power cable (to connect to the Raspberry Pi's “FAN” header), lid which clips onto the middle panel; the three case parts come pre-clipped together, the Raspberry Pi CPU (not included in Assembly kit) should be positioned between base and middle panel.

A: ## Raspberry Pi Case Assembly Plan - Step-by-Step

This plan outlines the assembly of the Raspberry Pi case, assuming a Raspberry Pi board *with* the CPU already installed is being used.

**Tools Needed:**

* (Optional) Plastic Spudger or similar non-marring tool - helpful for gently assisting with cable connections if needed.
* Clean, well-lit workspace.

**Parts Included:**

* 1 x Self-Adhesive Heat Sink
* 4 x Self-Adhesive Silicone Feet
* 1 x Three-Part Plastic Case (Base, Middle Panel w/Fan & Cable, Lid - pre-clipped)
* Raspberry Pi Board (CPU already installed - *NOT included in kit*)



**Assembly Steps:**

**Phase 1: Preparation - Raspberry Pi & Case Base (Approx. 2 minutes)**

1. **Heat Sink Application (Critical):**
   * **Locate CPU:** Identify the CPU (the primary chip) on your Raspberry Pi board.
   * **Peel Backing:** Carefully peel the protective backing from the self-adhesive heat sink.  *Avoid touching the adhesive surface.*
   * **Align & Apply:** Carefully align the heat sink directly over the CPU. Press firmly and evenly for 10-15 seconds to ensure a strong bond.  *Incorrect placement or insufficient pressure will reduce cooling effectiveness.*

2. **Silicone Feet Attachment:**
    * **Locate Foot Positions:** Identify the marked positions on the bottom of the case base where the silicone feet should be placed.
    * **Peel & Stick:** Peel the backing from one silicone foot.
    * **Apply & Repeat:** Firmly press the foot onto the designated position on the base. Repeat this process for the remaining three feet. *Ensure the feet are securely adhered.*

**Phase 2: Raspberry Pi Installation (Approx. 3-5 minutes)**

3. **Open Case (if necessary):** The base, middle panel & lid should arrive pre-clipped. If for some reason they are separated, gently re-clip the middle panel to the base.  The lid should snap onto the middle panel easily.

4. **Position Raspberry Pi:**
   *  Carefully position the Raspberry Pi board *between* the case base and the middle panel, ensuring the CPU (with the heatsink) is facing upwards toward the cooling fan within the middle panel.
   *  **Alignment is Key:** Align the Raspberry Pi's ports (HDMI, USB, Ethernet etc.) with the corresponding cutouts in the case base. 

5. **Connect Fan Cable:**
   * **Locate FAN Header:** Identify the "FAN" header on the Raspberry Pi board. (Consult your Raspberry Pi's documentation if unsure of location).
   * **Connect Cable:** Carefully connect the power cable attached to the cooling fan to the Raspberry Pi's "FAN" header. The connector is keyed and should only fit one way. *Do not force the connection.* If it’s difficult, gently use the plastic spudger to assist.

6. **Secure Raspberry Pi (Implicit):**  The design of the case should naturally hold the Raspberry Pi in place once the lid is attached.  Double check that the board is seated correctly before moving onto the next step.



**Phase 3: Final Assembly & Verification (Approx. 1 minute)**

7. **Attach Lid:**
   *  Carefully align the lid with the middle panel and gently press down until it clips securely into place. You should hear a click as the lid engages.

8. **Visual Inspection:**
   * **Confirm Secure Fit:** Verify that the lid and all components are securely attached.
   * **Port Access:** Ensure all ports on the Raspberry Pi are accessible through the case cutouts.
   * **Fan Operation (Initial Check - Power Up Required):**  *See step 9 for running a test to check the fan.*

9. **Power-On Check & Fan Verification:**
   * **Connect Power:** Connect the power supply to your Raspberry Pi.
   * **Boot & Observe:** Boot the Raspberry Pi.
   * **Fan Operation:** Verify the cooling fan is spinning. You may need to run a program that puts a load on the CPU to see the fan speed increase. (e.g., a simple stress test script).



**Important Notes:**

* **Static Electricity:**  Work on a static-free surface and consider using an anti-static wrist strap to prevent damage to the Raspberry Pi.
* **Gentle Handling:** Handle all components with care, especially the Raspberry Pi board.
* **Force:** Never force any connections. If something doesn't seem to fit, double-check alignment and consult the documentation.
* **CPU Heatsink:** Proper installation of the heat sink is crucial for preventing overheating.
* **Documentation:** Consult your Raspberry Pi's documentation for specific port locations and the function of the "FAN" header.

A: ## Bookcase Assembly Plan - Step-by-Step

This plan details the assembly of your bookcase. **Please read all instructions before beginning.** It's recommended to have a Phillips head screwdriver, a hammer, and a soft cloth to protect the finish.  Working on a protected surface (like a rug or cardboard) is also advisable.

**Safety First:** If you're using power tools, wear appropriate safety glasses.  If wall-mounting, ensure you're using appropriate fixings for your wall type.



**Phase 1: Preparing the Shelves & Skirting (Pre-Assembly - approx. 15 mins)**

1. **Dowels Insertion (Shelves & Skirting):** Gently tap 4 wooden dowels into each end of each of the three shelves.  Use a soft cloth between the hammer and dowel to avoid damage. Repeat this for the skirting board – 4 dowels into each end. *Ensure dowels are inserted firmly but don't force them.*
2. **Cam Screw Installation (Shelves):** Screw 4 cam screws into the screw plug holes on each end of each shelf.  *Do not overtighten - they need to protrude enough to engage with the cam locks but shouldn't bottom out.*

**Phase 2: Attaching Shelves & Skirting to One Side Panel (approx. 30 mins)**

1. **Positioning:** Lay ONE side panel flat on your protected work surface with the *inner face* (the one with the threaded holes) facing upwards.
2. **Skirting Board Attachment:** Align the dowels on one end of the skirting board with the corresponding holes in the side panel. Gently push the skirting board into place.
3. **First Shelf Placement:** Align the dowels on one end of the bottom shelf with the appropriate holes on the side panel. Position it a few inches above the skirting board (determine desired spacing now - consistent spacing is key!).  Gently push it into place.
4. **Second Shelf Placement:**  Position the middle shelf at your desired height and align its dowels with the holes on the side panel. Gentle push it into place.
5. **Third Shelf Placement:** Position the top shelf at your desired height and align its dowels with the holes on the side panel. Gentle push it into place.
6. **Cam Lock Insertion & Tightening:** For each shelf:
    * Locate the cam lock holes on the underside of the shelf where it meets the side panel.
    * Insert a cam lock into each hole. *Ensure the arrow on the cam lock is pointing *towards* the cam screw head.*
    * Using a Phillips head screwdriver, turn each cam lock clockwise about 180 degrees until it locks firmly.  *Do not overtighten!* This secures the shelf to the side panel.

**Phase 3: Attaching the Second Side Panel (approx. 20 mins)**

1. **Careful Alignment:** Carefully lift the partially assembled bookcase (side panel + shelving + skirting). 
2. **Second Side Panel Placement:** Carefully align the dowels on the *other* ends of the shelves and the skirting board with the corresponding holes in the SECOND side panel. *This can be tricky - take your time. Gently wiggle if necessary.*
3. **Push Together:** Slowly and evenly push the second side panel onto the shelves and skirting board, ensuring all dowels are fully inserted.
4. **Cam Lock Insertion & Tightening:** Repeat step 6 from Phase 2 for all shelves, securing them to the second side panel.




**Phase 4: Securing the Back Panel (approx. 15 mins)**

1. **Positioning:** Carefully stand the bookcase upright.
2. **Back Panel Insertion:** Slide the back panel into the vertical grooves on the inner rear side of both side panels. *Ensure it’s fully seated in both grooves.*
3. **Nailing:** Using the nails, secure the back panel to each shelf, ensuring even spacing of the nails. *Hammer nails carefully to avoid splitting the wood.* Start with a nail in each corner of each shelf, then evenly space the remaining nails.  The back panel will add a lot of rigidity to the bookcase.

**Phase 5: Final Steps & Optional Wall Mounting (approx. 10-30 mins)**

1. **Inspection:** Inspect the bookcase for stability. Gently push on it from various angles.  Ensure all cam locks are fully engaged.
2. **Cleaning:** Wipe down the bookcase to remove any dust or fingerprints.
3. **Optional: Wall Mounting:**
   * **Locate Studs:**  Use a stud finder to locate wall studs. *This is crucial for a secure mount.*
   * **Bracket Installation:** Attach the wall-mounting brackets to the back of the bookcase, using appropriate screws.
   * **Mount to Wall:** Position the bookcase against the wall and mark the bracket locations on the wall, aligning with the studs.  Pre-drill holes if necessary.
   * **Secure to Wall:** Securely attach the brackets to the wall using appropriate screws. *Ensure the bookcase is firmly anchored to the wall.*




**Important Notes:**

* **Don't Force:**  If something feels stuck, double-check alignment and ensure you’re using the correct holes.  Forcing can damage the wood.
* **Cam Lock Direction:**  The arrow on the cam lock *must* point towards the cam screw head for proper engagement.
* **Spacing:** Maintaining consistent spacing between shelves will create a more aesthetically pleasing bookcase.  Measure carefully!
* **Wall Mounting:** Wall mounting is *highly recommended*, especially for taller bookcases or if you have children or pets.




Congratulations, your bookcase is now assembled! Enjoy!

A: ## Bookcase Assembly Manual - Let's Build It!

**Congratulations on your new bookcase!** This manual will guide you through the assembly process, step-by-step. Don't worry if you're new to furniture assembly – we've kept it simple and clear.

**Before You Begin:**

* **Inventory:**  Lay out all the parts and check against the parts list above to make sure everything is included.
* **Space:** Find a clean, spacious, and well-lit area to work in.  Protect your floor with cardboard or a blanket.
* **Tools You’ll Need (Not Included):**
    * Phillips Head Screwdriver (Manual or Electric - *use low torque if electric!*)
    * Hammer
    * (Optional) Rubber Mallet - helpful for gently tapping in dowels.
    * (Optional) Level - for final adjustments.
    * (Optional) Drill - if you are using wall-mounting brackets.




**Let's Get Started!**

**Step 1: Preparing the Side Panels & Skirting Board**

1. **Identify the Inner Faces:**  Lay the two Side Panels flat.  The *inner faces* are the ones with the six threaded holes visible. Make sure you know which side is which - you'll be attaching everything to these!  The backs of the side panels have a groove running vertically – this is where the back panel will slide in.
2. **Insert Dowels (Skirting Board):**  Take the Skirting/Base Board. Carefully insert TWO wooden dowels into each end of the board.  Push them in firmly.  If they're a tight fit, gently tap them in with a rubber mallet (or carefully with a hammer and a protecting piece of wood). *Don’t force them!*
3. **Insert Dowels (Shelves - all three):** Repeat the dowel insertion process for each of the THREE Horizontal Shelves. Insert TWO wooden dowels into each end of each shelf.

**Step 2: Connecting the Skirting Board to the Side Panels**

1. **Positioning:** Stand one Side Panel upright. Carefully align the dowels on ONE end of the Skirting Board with the corresponding holes on the *inner face* of the Side Panel.
2. **Joining:** Gently push the Skirting Board onto the Side Panel, ensuring the dowels fully enter the holes.
3. **Repeat:** Repeat the process with the OTHER Side Panel and the other end of the Skirting Board. You should now have a U-shaped structure.

**Step 3: Attaching the First Shelf (Bottom Shelf)**

1. **Positioning:** Take ONE of the Horizontal Shelves. Align the dowels on one end of the shelf with the corresponding holes on the *inner face* of one of the Side Panels. Position this shelf as low as possible – this is the bottom shelf.
2. **Joining:**  Gently push the shelf onto the Side Panel, ensuring the dowels fully enter the holes.
3. **Cam Screw Installation (First Side):** Locate the two screw plug holes on the underside of the shelf, aligned with the matching holes in the side panel.  Insert TWO Cam Screws into these holes, and *gently* screw them in – just until they are snug. **Do NOT overtighten!**
4. **Cam Lock Installation (First Side):** Locate the two corresponding Cam Lock holes on the inner face of the side panel.  Insert a Cam Lock into each hole. *Make sure the arrow on the Cam Lock is pointing towards the Cam Screw!*.  Using a screwdriver, turn the Cam Lock clockwise until it clicks and feels secure. This locks the shelf in place.
5. **Repeat for Second Side**: Repeat steps 1-4 to attach the other end of the shelf to the other Side Panel.

**Step 4: Attaching the Remaining Shelves**

1. **Repeat Process:** Repeat Step 3 for the remaining TWO Horizontal Shelves.  Space them evenly between the bottom shelf and the top of the Side Panels.  Remember to use the dowels, cam screws, and cam locks to secure each shelf to both side panels.

**Step 5: Securing the Back Panel**

1. **Slide in Back Panel:** Carefully slide the Back Panel into the vertical groove on the back of both Side Panels. Make sure it’s fully seated.
2. **Nailing the Back Panel:** Using the nails provided, attach the Back Panel to the underside of each Horizontal Shelf. Space the nails evenly along the shelf's edge. *Be careful not to split the wood when nailing!*

**Step 6: Final Checks and Wall Mounting (Optional)**

1. **Stability Check:** Gently try to rock the bookcase. If there's any wobble, re-check that all dowels, cam screws, and cam locks are securely in place.
2. **Leveling:** Use a level to check if the bookcase is standing straight. If not, you can use small shims (not included) under the base to level it.
3. **Wall Mounting (Optional but Recommended):** *For safety and to prevent tipping, especially with heavier loads, we strongly recommend wall mounting.* 
    * Attach the provided wall-mounting brackets to the back of the bookcase, using appropriate screws (not included – choose screws appropriate for your wall type).
    *  Follow the instructions included with your wall-mounting brackets to secure the bookcase to the wall.




**Congratulations! You've assembled your new bookcase!** 

**Important Notes:**

*  **Don't Force Anything:** If a part doesn't fit easily, double-check the instructions and make sure you're using the correct pieces.
* **Overtightening:** Avoid overtightening screws, as this can damage the wood.
* **Safety First:**  If you're unsure about any step, please consult with someone experienced in furniture assembly.

*   Ensure the “minimum insertion line” on the stem is *fully* inside the steering tube. **Do not overtighten at this stage.**
*   Tighten the top stem bolt (6mm hex) to secure the handlebar and stem, but don’t fully tighten yet - adjustments may be needed later.

**Step 2: Saddle & Seat Post Installation**

*   Insert the seat post into the seat tube of the main frame.
*   Ensure the “minimum insertion line” on the seat post is *not* visible once inserted.
*   Tighten the seat clamp bolt (5mm hex) to secure the saddle.

**Step 3: Front Fender & Stays Installation (CRITICAL - MUST BE DONE BEFORE FRONT WHEEL)**

*   Position the front fender between the fork legs.
*   Attach the fender to the fork crown using the bolt and two flat washers. Tighten securely.
*   Attach the fender stays to the fork dropouts using the two 4mm hex bolts and one nut per stay. Tighten securely.

**Step 4: Front Wheel Installation**

*   Insert the front wheel axle into the fork dropouts.
*   Ensure the wheel is centered. 
*   Attach the axle nuts (15mm hex) to the axle, with the washers positioned *outside* of the nuts.
*   Tighten the axle nuts securely.

**Step 5: Pedal Installation**

*   **Important:** The right pedal (“R”) has a *clockwise* thread. The left pedal (“L”) has a *counterclockwise* thread.
*   Apply grease to the pedal threads.
*   Start threading the right pedal (R) into the right crank arm (drive side) – turn *clockwise*.
*   Start threading the left pedal (L) into the left crank arm – turn *counterclockwise*.
*   Tighten both pedals securely with a wrench.

**Step 6: Optional - Training Wheel Installation**

*   If installing training wheels, attach the square mounting plates to the rear frame dropouts using the 15mm hex bolt and washer. Tighten securely.
*   Reattach the rear fender above the training wheel using the provided fender strut.

**Step 7: Final Adjustments & Tightening**

*   Carefully set the bicycle upright.
*   Check all bolts and nuts are securely tightened: stem, saddle, front wheel, pedals, fender attachments.
*   Ensure the handlebars and saddle are adjusted to a comfortable position.
*   Test the brakes and steering to ensure safe operation.



**Safety Check:** Before allowing a child to ride, double-check that all components are securely fastened and that the bike is suitable for their size and ability.

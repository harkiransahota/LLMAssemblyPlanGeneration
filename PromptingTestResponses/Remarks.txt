Gemma:
Task 1:
preparation step added -Clearing Workspace protecting parts, Checking inventory
inserting the screw from the table top, even though it is explicitly described that the hole is 'on the bottom face only, not going all the way through' or through the whole leg into the table - did not understand the concept of a double ended screw
Task 2:
adds correct part orientation to the instructons - turning seat mechanism such that the lever is in the front of the seat or checking orientation of arm rest
in prompt 1, promt 3 and prompt 4 using force for caster wheel even though the part list describes 'caster wheels, each with a pre-attached screw for mounting'
in promt 3 Labeling the parts with A-J for better part referencing in the instructions
Task 3:
understands self adhisive part - peel off cover before sticking
prompt 1 asking to reclip the base and midle panel (if not preclipped) before inserting the Raspberry pi
prompt 2 also expecting to slide in the Pi between base and middle panel instead of opening it first
prompt 3 instructing to only seperate the lid from the connected base and midel panel and insert the Pi 
Does not understand 'should be positioned between base and middle panel' as disassebling the preclipped base and middle panel to plase the PI inbetween, instead it tires to slide it into place
Task 4:
prompt 1 inserting 4 wodden dowels into each end of three shelves and skirting board which makes a total of 32 dowels - the part list only states 16 dowels and only two dowel holes on each side for the shelves and skriting board
prompt 1 and prompt 2 confusing the cam screw - should be screwed in side board threaded holes not shleves, shelv holes are just for inserting the cam screw heads and locking in the cam lock
prompt 2 enven though strict format of response - step 1, step 2, .. is given by an example it ads a 'Before you begin' part with tools and workspace
prompt 2 and prompt 3 and prompt 4 positioning each shelf and the skriting boart directly inbetween both side panels which is more difficult, as inserting after the skriting board is already holding the side panels in place will require to pull the side panals apart which might damage the parts or dowels or holes
prompt 3 cofusing the cam screw holes and cam screw lock holes, inserting both through the bottom cam screw lock holes on the shelves after already placing the shelves inbetween the side panals
in promt 4 Labeling the parts with A-J for better part referencing in the instructions
prompt 4 wants to install four wodden dowels on side of the skriting board and cam screws in the cam screw holes of the skriting board even though the part list explicitly describes that the skirting board only has two wooden plug holes on each side 
Task 5:
recognises the order of front fender before tyre
Despite instruction 'reattach the rear fender above the training wheel using the provided fender strut' there is not previous instruction of removing the rear fender before

Given example in prompt 2 makes the response shorter and concise, follwing the example given (however sometimes omitting smaller instructions as loosening preinstalled bolts or clamps), otherwise a lot of 'friendly talking' is added as congratulations for buying or building the product 

for prompt 3 creating a user friendly manual it takes the freedom to add placeholders for pictures that should be added afterwards, and adding troubleshooting points

for prompt 4 also takes the freedom to add placeholders for images and adding troubleshooting

Deciding on required tools by itself like rubber mallets where gentle force has to be applied

Overall:
adding additional assembly hints as screwing in right direction, no overtightening, or cross pattern tightening
using a lot of double-check or recheck


CONCLUSION:

too much talking costs extra money without added value
adding tools at ones own direction can be fine or it has to be explicitly prohibited and LLM should stick to the given tools only



Qwen

Task 1:
wrongly inserting the double eneded screw into table to and leg an once screwing with a screwdriver, or assuming a through hole in the leg
prompt 2 - instead of following clear given instruction for output format (step 1, step 2, ...) it adds Parts&Tool requirement, you'll need section at the beginning and tips for success and greetings in the end
prompt 4 Adding a written diagram (text representation) of tabletop-screw-leg connection
Task 2:
changing the order of assembly during all prompts
prompt 3 - first attaching the arm rests to the back and then attaching the whole assembly to the seat, while holding it in place and screwing from the bottom side can be a bit cumbersome 
prompt 4 - first attaching the seat mechanism to the bottom part before screwing the seat upwards on can be a bit cumbersome and ergonomically not perfect
Task 3:
cleaning before attaching the silicone feet to case
handling self adhesive part well with removing the protection film first
prompt 1 - placing the PI correctly in the base and closing the case afterwards but no instruction for disassembly of preassembled case before
prompt 2 - handling disassembly of preassembled parts
prompt 3 - working with disassembled case but no instructions of disassembly first 
prompt 4 - cleaning before stick on, seperating case parts first
Task 4:
prompt 1, prompt 2, prompt 3 - positioning each shelf and the skriting boart directly inbetween both side panels which is more difficult, as inserting after the skriting board is already holding the side panels in place will require to pull the side panals apart which might damage the parts or dowels or holes
prompt 1- inserting the cam screws after side panels are connected to the shelves
prompt 2 - understood the concept and way of installation of cam screws and locks correctly
prompt 3 - cam screw inserted from the outside of the side panel
prompt 4 - first assembling the shleves and the side panels and then adding the cam screws on the innter face of side panels
Task 5:
recognises the order of front fender before tyre
prompt 1 - Despite instruction 'reattach the rear fender above the training wheel using the provided fender strut' there is not previous instruction of removing the rear fender before
prompt 2 - has instruction for temporarily removing rear fender stray for training wheel instalation
prompt 2- pay special attention to diefferent size fasteners with additional note
prompt 3, prompt 4 - lists parts for every step individually


Overall:
long thinking tags increasing length of responses
keeping other talking in the main response to a minimum adding some sdditional notes or troubleshooting
using a lot of double-check or recheck

CONCLUSION:

too much thinking costs extra money without added value





General:
Issue withou 3D Information - part list has to be very detailed, such as defining if a whole is in the corner or middle or if it is a threded or through hole etc.

the models also have issues with the right order for fender and tyre installation whereas fender and stay should be isntalled first into the fork before the tyreis placed in the fork because otherwise the tyre is in the way and the fender cannot be placed inside the fork - visually the models cannot see he set up so they cannot derive his logic so this has to be described in he text


random notes added as Keep small parts from Children or contact endor for missing parts

required steps such as cleaning before stick on can be derived from rules to ensure it Always is mentioned -> at least Basic rule base required

The result sytax varies every time if no explicit response form is provided (and even then a fixed format is not guranteed) which makes parsing for further processing very difficult just like human written instructions - this is a benefit of using rule based system that returns instructions in a strict format
